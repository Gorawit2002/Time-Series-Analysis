## üß© Key Features

- End-to-end time series forecasting using real financial data  
- Visualization of trends, seasonality, and residuals  
- Stationarity testing using ADF and differencing  
- Trend decomposition using STL  
- Forecasting with classical models:  
  - Naive Forecast  
  - Simple Moving Average (SMA)  
  - Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA)  
  - Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing  
  - ARIMA / ARIMAX  
  - SARIMA / SARIMAX  
- Model evaluation using RMSE, MAE  
- Model comparison with performance discussion and financial application insight

## üíº Professional Summary

This project provides hands-on experience in applying a variety of classical time series forecasting techniques on financial data. Each model is applied, tuned, and evaluated for its forecasting power, with results visualized and interpreted.  
It concludes with a comparative analysis to justify which models are better suited for financial engineering use cases such as stock prediction, risk assessment, and strategy planning.
